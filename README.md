# Quicko: QR-Based Food Ordering App




Quicko is a revolutionary mobile application developed using Flutter, aimed at transforming the way we order food. This application leverages the power of QR code scanning technology to expedite the ordering process, thus providing an unparalleled user experience.

It's not just efficient and user-friendly, but it also reduces physical contact and maintains a safer environment by eliminating the need for traditional paper menus.

This repository contains the entire codebase for Quicko, demonstrating the utilization of Flutter's comprehensive ecosystem and robust architecture. It stands as a testament to the fact that great applications can be created with code that is as appetizing as the food that it helps deliver!
